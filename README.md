# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

## Overview
This project explores customer churn patterns in a telecom service dataset using Python. By analyzing customer demographics, service usage, and tenure, I uncover actionable insights to help improve customer retention strategies.

## Dataset
Source: [Telco Customer Churn Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn
- Visual Studio Code with Jupyter Notebook

## Key Findings
- Month-to-month contract customers are more likely to churn
- Customers with lower tenure are more prone to leave
- Higher charges correlate with churn in specific segments

## Challenges
- Handling missing and inconsistent data
- Converting categorical variables for visualization

## Learnings
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Structured documentation and communication of insights

## Next Steps
- Implement machine learning models for churn prediction
- Experiment with advanced feature engineering and dashboards
